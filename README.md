## About

Make trolls and unicorns jump across the bottom of your screen.

Perfect for running when your automated tests pass.

## Install

`make trolleap unicornleap`

Put the "trolleap" and "unicornleap" commands somewhere on your PATH

## Usage

For running if and when rspec tests pass:

Copy .rspec.example to your home directory as .rspec, and set the path to after_specs.rb

## TODO

Figure out how to get "should_receive" failures to be reported as failures
